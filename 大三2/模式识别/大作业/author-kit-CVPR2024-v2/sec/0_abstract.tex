With the rapid development of deep learning and computer vision technologies, visual perception systems have made significant progress in tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and scene understanding. However, traditional visual perception models often rely on predefined closed vocabulary sets, limiting their ability to handle unseen objects and scenes. To overcome this limitation, open-vocabulary visual perception has emerged, enabling the recognition and understanding of a large, potentially unlimited, set of new vocabularies. This significantly enhances the generality and flexibility of visual perception systems. Among the various applications of open-vocabulary visual perception, scene understanding is a key research area. Scene understanding requires not only recognizing individual objects in an image but also understanding the relationships between objects, the semantic structure of the scene, and the context of the overall environment, which is crucial for applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent surveillance, and augmented reality. This paper reviews the downstream applications of open-vocabulary visual perception in scene understanding, focusing on the research presented in three papers: \textit{From Pixels to Graphs: Open-Vocabulary Scene Graph Generation with Vision-Language Models}, \textit{OpenMask3D: Open-Vocabulary 3D Instance Segmentation}, and \textit{OVER-NAV: Elevating Iterative Vision-and-Language Navigation with Open-Vocabulary Detection and Structured Representation}. These papers introduce technologies related to open-vocabulary visual perception in scene understanding, covering various techniques and providing insights into the field.
